# How to set a custom font
- Install [Themer](https://github.com/Vendicated/AliucordPlugins/raw/builds/Themer.zip) plugin
- Install this [file manager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.zhanghai.android.files) & open it (or any file manager that lets you copy file paths)
- Find the font file
- Click the 3 dots next to it & press `Copy path`
- Go to Themer settings → your theme → `Fonts` & paste it where the asterisk is
- Add `file:/` at the start
 
Final result should be `file://storage/emulated/0/Example/Example.ttf`
 
Don't forget to enable the `Enable Custom Fonts` option in Themer settings
